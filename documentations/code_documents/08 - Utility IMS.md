# Utility IMS

## Utility Dashboard

The dashboard utilizes the following tools to deliver data and insights:

-   Charts: Created with Chart.js for visual representation of trends.
-   Cards: Built with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.
-   Icons: SVG and Font Awesome.

### Data Retrieval

-   Controller: The UtilityDashboardController (located at app\\Http\\Controllers\\UtilityInfo) initiates data fetching.
-   Service Class: The UtilityDashboardService (located at app\\Services\\UtilityInfo) has been called by controller to perform necessary operations.

Charts

-   Data Fetching: Laravel Eloquent & Raw SQL queries are used to fetch data for charts.

### Views

**Layout:** The core dashboard structure is defined in the resources\\views\\dashboard\\utilityDashboard.blade.php file. This file acts as the overall layout and likely includes placeholders for the various components.

Charts are fetched from resources\\views\\dashboard\\charts.

## Road Network

### Tables

Road Network is under Utility IMS module and uses the following table:

roads: stores with information related to road infrastructure.

The corresponding tables have their respective models that are named in Pascal Case in singular form. Roadline model is located at app\\Models\\UtilityInfo\\.

### Views

All views used by this module is stored in resources\\views\\utility-info\\road-lines

road-lines.index: lists help desks records.

road-lines.create: opens form and calls partial-form for form contents

road-lines.partial-form: creates form content

road-lines.edit: opens form and calls partial-form for form contents

road-lines.history: lists all past edits of the record

### Models

The models contain the connection between the model and the table defined by \$table = ‘utility_info.roads’ as well as the primary key defined by primaryKey= ‘code’

Roadline Model

Location: app\\Models\\UtilityInfo\\Roadline.php

There are multiple relationships defined in the Roadline Model. They are:

buildings: belongsToMany relationship (1 to n relationship)

### Roadline Request

Location: app\\Http\\Requests\\UtilityInfo\\RoadLineRequest.php

RoadLineRequest handles all validation. It handles validation logic as well as error messages to be displayed.

Roadline follows CRUD operations, which usually have the same pattern. You can refer to the "Basic CRUD" Section **2 - Technical Information/ Basic CRUD** for more information.

However, New roads can be added directly to the map using the **Add Road** tool, and existing roads can be updated using the **Edit Road on Map** tool. The details are provided below:

##### Add Road

-   Initial steps are explained below in Initialize having id value (“add_submit_control”).

- Prevent default behavior using e.preventDefault().

- Retrieve the code from the data-code attribute.

- Convert current layer type (Road, Sewer, etc.) to lowercase for dynamic use.

-  If the current control is "Add Road" or "Add Sewer", etc.:

     - Check if features are drawn on the map (drawLayer.getSource().getFeatures()).

     - If no features, show warning using SweetAlert.

     - If features exist, toggle the corresponding add form using jQuery
     -  After clicking the save on the form, it prevents the default form submission and instead calls a custom function "**submitDetails()**" with the passed arguments. this function is explained in supporing function.

-   If a modification was made:
     
     - Hide any open form.

     - If a feature has been modified (hasModification is true and modifiedFeature exists): Ask for confirmation using SweetAlert then on confirm:

          - Clone and transform the geometry from EPSG:3857 to EPSG:4326.

          - Calculate the total length: for LineString: use getLength() and for MultiLineString: sum up each line segment's length

**handleMapControl()**

- The function takes parameters as "controlId" , "layerName", "toolBoxId", "geoServerLayer".
    - controlId - The ID of the map control (e.g., '#add_road_control', '#add_sewer_control').
    - layerName - The name to assign to the feature display layer.

- Retrieves an array of all layers currently on the map.

- Removes a visual "active" state from all control buttons.

- Checks if the current control is already active, disable it and exit using function as "**resetAddTool()**", "**disableAllControls()**"explained in supporting function.

- If active, it activate the new control and show toolbox.

- Load existing features from GeoServer WFS into a vector layer and display existing features from GeoServer.

- Creates a drawLayer and drawSource for user-drawn geometries.

- Adds the vectorLayer and drawLayer if it’s not already on the map.

- Sets a listener to detect when features are fully loaded and then removes the loader.
 

**addModifyInteractions()**

- The function takes parameters as "currentAddControl" , "code", "utilityType".

    - currentAddControl - Keeps track of the current tool/mode.
    - code - The ID of current layer passed in url.
    - utilityType - The name of the layer.

- Removes existing interactions from the map to prevent conflicts.

- Clears old features from the source so only the one being edited appears.
- Sends a GET request through AJAX.
- The backend returns the WKT (Well-Known Text) geometry for the specific utility item.
- Converts the WKT string to an OpenLayers feature.

- Ensures correct projection and creates a collection.

- Applies custom styling for selection.

- Enables modifying geometry, and undo/redo functionality.

- Activates all the relevant tools on the map (modification, snapping, undo/redo).

- When a user finishes editing the geometry, this stores the modified feature and flags it as changed.

- Prevents the user from selecting or editing any other feature.

- Keeps only the intended feature selected.

- Uses a warning popup (SweetAlert2) if the user selects something else.

- Also prevents deselecting the feature by clicking outside.

- Resets any previous undo/redo state so it starts fresh for the selected feature.

**disableAllControls()**

-   disables all controls on an OpenLayers map. Overall, this function is used to reset the map to its original state and remove any previous actions performed on it.

-   The function first removes any interactions (draw, drag) and event listeners (pointermove, singleclick) that have been added to the map.

-   It then removes any overlay tooltips and hides a "layer-select-box" element.

-   Finally, it clears any features that may have been added to the map layers .

**resetAddTool()**

- Resets the current control used for adding features by setting currentAddControl to an empty string ('').

- Removes all interactions (like drawing or modifying) from the map that are related to adding new features (removeAllAddInteractions()).

- Clears temporary layers that were used while adding features (clearAddlayers()).

**hideAddForm()**

-   This line uses jQuery to select all elements with the class add-road-form.

-   The slideUp() function is then called on these selected elements that hides the selected elements by sliding them up.

**removeDrawnFeatures()**

-   When this function is called, it removes all drawn roads or features from the specified draw layer on the map. This is achieved by clearing the data source associated with the layer.

**addDrawInteractions()**

-   Remove any existing modify and select interactions from the map. These interactions might be present to modify or select existing features on the map.

-   Creates a new draw interaction for drawing layers on the map. It specifies the source where the drawn features will be added (drawSource) and sets the type of geometry that can be drawn, in this case, "MultiLineString" which means multiple lines can be drawn.

-   Creates a snap interaction to snap the vertices of the drawn layers to existing features on the map. It specifies the source from which to snap vertices (vectorSource).

-   Creates another snap interaction, but this time it's for snapping the vertices of the newly drawn layers to each other. It specifies the source from which to snap vertices (drawSource).

-   creates an Undo/Redo interaction, which allows users to undo and redo their drawing actions.

-   Add the draw, snap, and undo interactions to the map.

-   Attaches an event listener to the draw interaction's "drawstart" event. This function is triggered when the user starts drawing a new layer. Within this event listener, it hides the form used for adding layers ‘**hideAddForm**()’ and removes any previously drawn layers ‘**removeDrawnFeatures**()’. These two function: ‘**hideAddForm**()’ and ‘**removeDrawnFeatures**()’ are further explained in supporting functions.

**submitDetails()**

- This function handles form submission for different utility layers (e.g., road, sewer, drain, watersupply) by dynamically building form data, validating geometry, and sending an AJAX request to the appropriate endpoint.

- controlType – It determines which form and fields to process. It accepts:'road','sewer','drain','watersupply'.

- Based on controlType specific setup following are determined:
     - geom = Retrieves the geometry drawn on the map. This function "**getGeometryLayer()**" is explained separately in the supporting function section.

     - fieldNameMapping – Maps the form field names to user-friendly labels for error messages.
     
     - formData – Collects the values from the HTML input fields dynamically based on the selected control type. 

     - url – Defines the POST API endpoint where the form data and geometry should be submitted.

     - return_url – Specifies the URL to redirect to after a successful form submission.

**getGeometryLayer()**

- Returns the WKT (Well-Known Text) representation of the last drawn geometry from the OpenLayers drawing source, transformed into the correct coordinate system (EPSG:4326 for lat/lng).
